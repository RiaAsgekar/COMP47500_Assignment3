# COMP47500 Assignment3

# COMPARISON OF INSERTION AND DELETION TIMES IN SORTED SEQUENCE, UNSORTED SEQUENCE AND HEAP BASED PRIORITY QUEUES

This assignment involves the implementation of three different implementations of priority queues:Sorted sequence, unsorted sequence and using heap. The main purpose is to compare their performance in terms of insertion and deletion operations using the dataset.

Contents:

Main.java: This file contains the main test class where experiments for insertion and deletion operations are conducted.

PQ_SortedSeq.java: Sorted sequence implementation of priority queue.

PQ_UnsortedSeq.java: Unsorted sequence implementation of priority queue. 

PriorityQueueUsingHeap.java: Heap implementation of priority queue.

Node.java: Includes constructors to initialize the node and assigns priority. 

Experimentation:

Insertion: The insertion() method conducts experiments to measure the time taken for inserting each data point into each implementation. Time measurements are in nanoseconds.

Deletion: The delete() method conducts experiments to measure the time taken for deletion of each data point into each implementation. Time measurements are in nanoseconds.

Note: The experiments are conducted with the dataset chosen to evaluate the performance of each implementation type.

This README provides an overview of the provided code files, their functionalities, and the purpose of the experimentation conducted within the Main.java class.
